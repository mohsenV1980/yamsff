Yet another MPLS stack for FreeBSD (yamsff)
===========================================

This software is derived from present MPLS implementation in current OpenBSD
release.

NOTE:	This stuff compiles, but MPLS related components are untested!!!.
NOTE:
NOTE:	At the moment, I'm using github as online storage for something 
NOTE:	I've started (re-)developing. Yet, it is better then storing all  
NOTE:	stuff locally on my (insecure) workstation.
NOTE:
NOTE: 	Therfore, this software is under active developement and far from
NOTE: 	correctness and contains (some serious) flaws implecitely.
NOTE: 	
NOTE: 	Due to the upcoming Operating System Crisis in software industry, 
NOTE: 	purpose of this operation is to teach myself about MPLS and protocol
NOTE: 	integration in kernel space of BSD based OS's or OS's where its
NOTE: 	implementation of system or network protocols is based or derived 
NOTE:	from codebase of BSD based OS's.
NOTE: 	
NOTE: 	Stern warning: Do not use this software or in production environments!

Don't panic!!! I've started testing.

Further, I'll add modefied ifconfig(8) and route(8) commands, after testing 
MPLS related components.

Finally, I'll add more detailed description implementation notes.

Btw, I am a very busy person.
