Yet another MPLS stack for FreeBSD (yams)
=========================================

This software is derived from present implementation in current OpenBSD
release.

IMHO it is better to derive then reinventing the wheel (NIH syndrome).

NOTE:	This stuff won't compile yet, but soon - I'll fix it!!! :-).
NOTE:
NOTE: 	Therfore this software is under active developement and far from
NOTE: 	correctness and contains (some serious) flaws implecitely.
NOTE: 	
NOTE: 	Due to the upcoming Operating System Crisis in software industry, 
NOTE: 	purpose of this operation is to teach myself about MPLS and protocol
NOTE: 	integration in kernel space of BSD based OS's or OS's where its
NOTE: 	implementation of system or network protocols is based or derived 
NOTE:	from codebase of BSD based OS's.
NOTE: 	
NOTE: 	Stern warning: Do not use this software in production environments!
