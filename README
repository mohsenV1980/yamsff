Yet another MPLS stack for FreeBSD (yamsff)
===========================================

This software is derived from present MPLS implementation in current OpenBSD
release.

NOTE:	This software and its components are under active developement and far
NOTE: 	from correctness and containing (some serious) flaws implecitely.
NOTE: 	
NOTE: 	Purpose of this operation is to teach myself about MPLS and protocol
NOTE: 	integration in kernel space of BSD based OS's or OS's where its
NOTE: 	implementation of system or network protocols is based or derived 
NOTE:	from codebase of BSD based OS's for a better understanding the 
NOTE:   underlying principles for designing and implementing of operating 
NOTE:   systems in general.
NOTE: 	
NOTE: 	Stern warning: Do not use this software in production environments!

Next tasks:
-----------
 
 o Testing components and bugfixes.
 o Adding modefied ifconfig(8) and route(8) commands.
 o Writing detailed implementation notes.
 o Starting of tasks for a better understanding of 
   IPv6 implementation in sys/netinet6.
